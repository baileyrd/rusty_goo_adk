# Release Notes

<!--
Two variants, pick the one that fits this repo's actual unit of change:

1. No version tags yet (pre-1.0, nothing published) — track by PR instead, same way
   AISF does it: one entry per merged PR against main, reverse chronological, each
   linking to its PR and (where one exists) to the doc that covers the change in full
   detail. Use "## PR #N — <summary>" headers.

2. Actual version tags exist — use "## vX.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD" headers instead, each
   linking to the PRs it shipped and a compare link to the previous tag. Add an
   "### Upgrade notes" subsection under any entry with a breaking change.

Either way, keep the tone AISF's file uses: bolded category tags inline in the
bullet (**Added:** / **Changed:** / **Fixed:**), not separate subheaders per
category — and state known limitations or deliberate scope cuts plainly instead of
leaving them implied.
-->

Notable changes to this repo, one entry per merged PR against `main`, newest first.

## PR #TBD — Phase 3 batch 2: Gemini client construction & config layer
**2026-08-22** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** the `Gemini` struct (`model`/`client`/`client_kwargs`/
  `base_url`/`api_version`/`speech_config`/`use_interactions_api`/
  `retry_options`), `supported_models()`, `api_client`/`GeminiApiClient`
  construction (tracking headers, `enterprise` flag, base-URL/API-version
  resolution), and `_configured_api_version`/
  `_normalize_base_url_and_api_version` (C0123, C0124, C0129, C0130). Also
  added `google_client_headers` (`get_client_labels`/`get_tracking_headers`/
  `merge_tracking_headers`, C0133 partial). 25 new tests.
- **New dependency, disclosed:** the `reqwest` crate (`rustls-tls`
  feature, no native/OpenSSL TLS) as the HTTP/SSE transport for the Gemini
  REST API. This is the sovereignty-sensitive dependency decision the
  Phase 3 batch 1 `regex` note explicitly contrasted itself with — every
  sibling Rusty-Mill repo under the platform directory
  (`rusty_time`/`rusty_err`/`rustils_async`/`rusty_tokio`/`rusty_json`/
  `rusty_std`/`rusty_uuid`/`rusty_serde`) was checked for an HTTP/TLS
  candidate the manifest's own sibling-check methodology names
  (`rusty_http`/`rusty_request`, `rusty_tls`) — none exists. Only the
  REST/SSE transport is decided here; the Live API's WebSocket transport
  is a separate decision for the batch that implements `connect()`.
- **Adaptation, disclosed:** `client_kwargs` (the source's free-form dict
  merged into the `genai.Client` constructor, capable of overriding any
  constructor argument) has no well-typed Rust equivalent without knowing
  which keys matter, so it stays an inert opaque placeholder — documented
  in `gemini.rs`'s module doc, same treatment as `tools_dict` in
  `llm_request.rs`.
- **Scope decision:** this batch covers only pure configuration logic
  testable without a live network call. Deferred to further batches:
  `generate_content_async`'s actual REST/SSE wire calls, context-cache
  integration, and interactions-API delegation (C0125/C0126/C0128 — need
  real `GenerateContentConfig`/`GenerateContentResponse`/`Tool`/
  `FunctionDeclaration` wire types beyond today's load-bearing-subset
  `LlmRequest`/`LlmResponse`); `_ResourceExhaustedError` (C0127 — wraps an
  HTTP error that only exists once real calls exist); the Live
  `connect()`/`GeminiLlmConnection`/computer-use preprocessing
  (C0131/C0132/C0135-C0139 — need a WebSocket transport decision);
  redacted request/response debug logging (C0134 — needs the real wire
  types above); and `GeminiContextCacheManager` (C0140-C0143 — needs a
  SHA-256 crate decision plus the cache-creation HTTP call). See
  `crates/adk-models/src/gemini.rs`'s module doc for the full breakdown.
- 4 rows marked `DONE` with per-row test-name evidence in
  `capability-manifest.md`; Phase 3 sits at 19 of 43 rows complete.

## PR #TBD — Phase 3 batch 1: model layer core (BaseLlm/LlmRequest/LlmResponse/LLMRegistry)
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** `adk-genai` crate — a minimal, *real* (not opaque) Rust subset
  of `google.genai.types`: `Content`/`Part`/`FunctionCall`/`FunctionResponse`,
  covering exactly the fields `google/adk-python`'s own code touches
  (confirmed by grepping every `part.*`/`content.*` access across the
  source tree). This isn't an ADK capability of its own — these types
  belong to the third-party `google-genai` package — but `LlmRequest`/
  `LlmResponse` (this batch's own capabilities) can't have real behavior
  without it.
- **Added:** `adk-models` crate — `BaseLlm` (trait, capabilities self-report
  with deprecated name-based fallback, `supported_models`, default
  `NotImplementedError`-equivalent `generate_content_async`/`connect`),
  `BaseLlmConnection` (live-connection trait), `LLMRegistry` (regex-based
  model-name dispatch, `prefix:model` override syntax, helpful
  unresolvable-model errors), `LlmRequest` (`append_instructions`,
  `insert_transient_user_content`, `set_output_schema`), `LlmResponse`
  (`get_function_calls`/`get_function_responses`), `CacheMetadata`
  (two-state active/fingerprint-only model). 37 new tests.
- **Retroactive completions, now that real `Content`/`Part` exist:**
  `Event::is_final_response`/`has_trailing_code_execution_result` (Phase 1,
  C0022/C0023 — left partial there, now finished), `InvocationContext`'s
  `should_pause_invocation`/`find_matching_function_call`/
  `stamp_event_branch_context` (Phase 2, completing C0071), and
  `LlmAgent`'s `_get_subagent_to_resume`/`__maybe_save_output_to_state`/
  `__maybe_accumulate_streaming_output` (Phase 2, C0094/C0095). 20 total
  rows across three phases moved to `DONE` by this batch alone.
- **New dependency:** the `regex` crate, for `LLMRegistry`'s model-name
  pattern matching — no sibling `rusty_regex` exists in the platform
  directory, and this isn't a sovereignty-sensitive surface the way an
  HTTP client or crypto library would be.
- **Scope decision:** the native Gemini backend (`Gemini`,
  `GeminiLlmConnection`, `GeminiContextCacheManager` — C0123-C0143, 21
  rows) is deferred to a follow-up batch. It needs a real HTTP/WebSocket
  client to Google's API — a dependency decision on the same scale as
  Phase 2's async-runtime choice — and deserves its own sibling-repo check
  before hand-rolling, per the migration's own step 3.
- **Known gaps, flagged not hidden:** `LlmResponse.create()` (needs the raw
  Gemini SDK response type), `LlmRequest.append_tools` (needs `BaseTool`,
  Phase 8), the LiteLLM provider-list fallback and real lazy provider
  registrations (`Gemini`/`Claude`/`LiteLlm`/etc. — no backends exist yet
  to register) all stay `REQUIRED`.
- 20 rows marked `DONE` with per-row test-name evidence in
  `capability-manifest.md` (15 in Phase 3, plus the 5 retroactive
  completions above); Phase 3 sits at 15 of 43 rows complete, with the
  remaining 28 concentrated in the deferred Gemini-backend cluster.

## PR #TBD — Phase 2 batch 2: LlmAgent config shape + task-delegation models
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** `LlmAgent`'s config fields and the handful of methods that
  don't need Phase 3/4/8 to exist: `canonical_instruction`/
  `canonical_global_instruction` (string-or-provider resolution), the
  `generate_content_config` validator (rejects `tools`/`system_instruction`/
  `response_schema`/`http_options.base_url` set there), the `_llm_flow`
  single-vs-auto flow *decision*, `set_default_model`/`set_default_live_model`,
  and the 6 model/tool callback fields' stop-at-first-non-`None` chain
  contract. Plus `TaskRequest`/`TaskResult`/`DefaultTaskInput`/
  `DefaultTaskOutput` (task-delegation payload shapes — fully self-contained,
  no forward references). 21 new tests (155 total workspace-wide), clippy/fmt
  clean.
- **Scope decision:** `LlmAgent` is implemented as a standalone struct this
  batch, not yet wired into `BaseAgent`'s tree/`AgentBehavior` — its real
  behavior (`canonical_model`, `canonical_tools`, `_run_async_impl`) is
  driven entirely by types this migration hasn't built yet (`BaseLlm`/
  `LlmRequest`/`LlmResponse`/`LLMRegistry` — Phase 3; `BaseTool`/
  `BaseToolset`/`ToolContext` — Phase 8; `BaseLlmFlow`/`SingleFlow`/
  `AutoFlow`/planners — Phase 4). Wiring it into the tree now would mean
  giving it a `_run_async_impl` that can't actually run anything; that
  integration happens once those phases land.
- **Known gaps, flagged not hidden** — left `REQUIRED`: `canonical_model`/
  `canonical_live_model` (need `LLMRegistry`), `canonical_tools` (needs
  `BaseTool` resolution), `_get_subagent_to_resume`/
  `__maybe_save_output_to_state`/`__maybe_accumulate_streaming_output`
  (blocked on Phase 3's real `Content`/`Part` — `Event.get_function_calls`/
  `get_function_responses` don't exist yet), `_pre_validate_tools`'s
  tool/sub-agent auto-wrapping (needs `BaseNode`/`BaseTool`/
  `FinishTaskTool`), the deprecated YAML config pipeline (needs the same
  design decision as `BaseAgent::from_config`), and `FinishTaskTool` itself
  (needs `BaseTool`/`LlmRequest`/`ToolContext`).
- 13 more Phase 2 rows marked `DONE` (51 of 66 in the `agents/` phase now
  complete) with per-row test-name evidence in `capability-manifest.md`.
  Phase 2's remaining 15 rows are all blocked on later phases landing
  first — Phase 2 itself is otherwise complete for what's buildable today.

## PR #TBD — Phase 2 batch 1: BaseAgent + Context/InvocationContext/RunConfig
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** `adk-agents` crate covering `BaseAgent` (name/parent-tree
  validation, before/after-agent callback chains with plugin-precedence and
  error-notification-then-reraise, clone, tree-walk helpers) and the
  `Context`/`ReadonlyContext`/`InvocationContext` family (state, output,
  route, interrupt-ids, event-author, artifact/credential/memory
  tool-context methods, agent-state machine, per-invocation LLM-call-limit
  enforcement), plus `RunConfig`/`ToolThreadPoolConfig`/`LiveRequest`/
  `LiveRequestQueue`/`ActiveStreamingTool`/`ContextCacheConfig`/
  `TranscriptionEntry`/`StreamingMode`. 73 new tests (134 total across the
  workspace), clippy/fmt clean.
- **Runners.py inventory gap closed:** a dedicated read of `runners.py`
  (2609 lines, flagged in row C0788 as outside the original 8-agent
  inventory's scope) added 94 granular capability rows (C0833-C0926,
  Phase 2) — the `Runner`/`InMemoryRunner` execution engine's actual
  sub-capabilities, previously referenced only piecemeal by other reports.
- **Async runtime decision:** `rusty_tokio` adopted (pinned git-rev) — the
  first capability needing one, `LiveRequestQueue`'s `asyncio.Queue`
  equivalent. Chosen over `rustils_async`, which is a narrow OS-level
  async-I/O primitives layer (process/fs/net) with no task-spawning or
  channel API; `rusty_tokio` is a general-purpose runtime matching what
  ADK's in-process task/queue orchestration needs.
- **Disclosed adaptations** (each documented in its module's doc comment):
  tree ownership via `Arc`+`OnceLock` back-pointer (mirrors the "adopted as
  a sub-agent only once" invariant as a single `OnceLock::set` failure);
  `_run_async_impl`/`_run_live_impl` represented as eagerly-collected
  `Vec<Event>` rather than a live stream, since no concrete agent subclass
  yet needs incremental yielding; `sessions.state.State` (Phase 5) and a
  minimal `Session` placeholder pulled forward since `Context` cannot
  compile without them; `PluginManager` (Phase 7) is real but structurally
  always returns `None` for the zero-plugins-registered case.
- **Known gaps, flagged not hidden:** `BaseAgent._run_impl` (needs
  `workflow::BaseNode`, Phase 7), `BaseAgent::from_config` dynamic
  resolution (needs a design decision — no Rust equivalent to Python's
  dotted-path dynamic loading), `Context.run_node`/`_run_node_internal`
  (needs the Phase 7 workflow engine), `InvocationContext`'s live-mode
  fields and `_enqueue_event` (need a concrete live-mode consumer),
  and `should_pause_invocation`/`_find_matching_function_call`/
  `stamp_event_branch_context` (blocked on Phase 3's real `Content`/`Part`)
  all stay `REQUIRED` in the manifest, not marked `DONE`.
- `LlmAgent` (C0079-C0100) is deferred to a follow-up batch — it has the
  heaviest forward-reference surface (models/`BaseLlm`, tools, planners,
  flows) of anything in Phase 2.
- 38 of the addressed Phase 2 rows marked `DONE` with per-row test-name
  evidence in `capability-manifest.md`.

## PR #TBD — Phase 1: platform/errors/events primitives (C0001-C0033)
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** Cargo workspace with three crates —
  `adk-platform` (random/time/uuid providers, thread factory),
  `adk-errors` (6 error types + the `ValueErrorLike` marker trait), and
  `adk-events` (`Event`/`EventActions`/`RequestInput`/`NodeInfo`/
  `EventCompaction`/`UiWidget`/branch-path and node-path helpers/
  `apply_rewinds`) — implementing all 33 Phase 1 capabilities. 61 tests,
  `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- **Sibling-crate decisions:** `rusty_uuid`, `rusty_time`, and `rusty_err`
  adopted as pinned git-rev workspace dependencies after inspection (per the
  user's direction to check `rustils_async`/`rusty_tokio` and
  `rusty_serde`/`rusty_json`/`rusty_uuid`/`rusty_rand` first); `rusty_serde`
  chosen over `rusty_json` for serialization (fully sovereign, zero
  external deps) at the user's explicit direction. No async runtime is
  adopted yet — Phase 1 needs none; the tokio/rusty_tokio/rustils_async
  choice is deferred to whichever later phase first needs an executor.
- **Adaptation, disclosed:** the source's `ContextVar`-scoped provider
  pattern (random/time/uuid) is ported to `thread_local!` instead, since no
  async runtime is chosen yet — documented inline in each provider module
  and revisitable once a runtime lands.
- **Adaptation, disclosed:** `Event(LlmResponse)` needs ~20 fields from
  `LlmResponse` (Phase 3, not yet built); those fields are flattened onto
  `Event` as typed placeholders (mostly `rusty_serde::value::Value`) with a
  documented plan to replace them with `#[rusty_serde(flatten)] base:
  LlmResponse` once Phase 3 lands.
- **Known gap, flagged not hidden:** C0022 (`is_final_response`) and C0023
  (`has_trailing_code_execution_result`) are left `REQUIRED`, not `DONE` —
  both need real `Content`/`Part` inspection from Phase 3 for true parity;
  this port's versions cover only the branches that don't depend on those
  types.
- 31 of the 33 Phase 1 manifest rows marked `DONE` with per-row test-name
  evidence in `capability-manifest.md`; C0022/C0023 remain `REQUIRED`.

## PR #TBD — Capability roadmap: full 831-row manifest for the google/adk-python migration
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** `capability-manifest.md` — the complete capability inventory for
  the migration, one row per capability with a stable `C####` id, grouped into
  17 dependency-ordered phases (P1 core primitives through P17 deferred
  decisions). Built from 8 parallel read-only inventory passes over
  `google/adk-python`'s ~206k lines / 28 top-level modules.
- **Known limitation:** the `Existing RustyMill impl` column is populated only
  where a repo/purpose match was obvious from `platform-directory.md`'s
  heuristic — a full `scan_platform_repos.sh` pass per capability wasn't run
  at this scale; it's re-checked per-issue when each capability is actually
  worked (per the rust-migration skill's step 3).
- **Known gap, flagged not hidden:** `runners.py` (the core `Runner`/
  `InMemoryRunner` execution engine, 2609 lines) sits outside the 28 scoped
  module directories and wasn't deep-dived by any of the 8 inventory agents —
  row `C0788` flags this explicitly as a required follow-up read before P2
  can be considered fully scoped, rather than silently omitting it.
- Every row defaults `REQUIRED` per the migration's boundary contract;
  `scripts/check_manifest_coverage.sh` confirms all 831 rows parse and are
  correctly in a non-terminal state (nothing migrated yet, as expected).
- No GitHub issues have been filed yet — the user asked for the manifest
  organized into phases first, to review and pace the work themselves.

## PR #TBD — Bootstrap governance files; begin rust-migration of google/adk-python
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** standard governance file set (repo-config) — README, ARCHITECTURE,
  CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES, ADR seed,
  PR/issue templates, `.gitattributes` (`eol=lf`).
- **Known limitation:** no Cargo workspace exists yet, so no CI workflow was
  added (repo-config skips CI generation when there's no stack manifest to run
  against) and README's Getting Started section is a placeholder.
- This is the first PR of an ongoing rust-migration-skill loop porting
  [google/adk-python](https://github.com/google/adk-python) to Rust; see
  `capability-manifest.md` (added in a follow-up PR) for the tracked capability
  list.

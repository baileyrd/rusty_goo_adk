# Release Notes

<!--
Two variants, pick the one that fits this repo's actual unit of change:

1. No version tags yet (pre-1.0, nothing published) — track by PR instead, same way
   AISF does it: one entry per merged PR against main, reverse chronological, each
   linking to its PR and (where one exists) to the doc that covers the change in full
   detail. Use "## PR #N — <summary>" headers.

2. Actual version tags exist — use "## vX.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD" headers instead, each
   linking to the PRs it shipped and a compare link to the previous tag. Add an
   "### Upgrade notes" subsection under any entry with a breaking change.

Either way, keep the tone AISF's file uses: bolded category tags inline in the
bullet (**Added:** / **Changed:** / **Fixed:**), not separate subheaders per
category — and state known limitations or deliberate scope cuts plainly instead of
leaving them implied.
-->

Notable changes to this repo, one entry per merged PR against `main`, newest first.

## PR #TBD — Phase 1: platform/errors/events primitives (C0001-C0033)
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** Cargo workspace with three crates —
  `adk-platform` (random/time/uuid providers, thread factory),
  `adk-errors` (6 error types + the `ValueErrorLike` marker trait), and
  `adk-events` (`Event`/`EventActions`/`RequestInput`/`NodeInfo`/
  `EventCompaction`/`UiWidget`/branch-path and node-path helpers/
  `apply_rewinds`) — implementing all 33 Phase 1 capabilities. 61 tests,
  `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- **Sibling-crate decisions:** `rusty_uuid`, `rusty_time`, and `rusty_err`
  adopted as pinned git-rev workspace dependencies after inspection (per the
  user's direction to check `rustils_async`/`rusty_tokio` and
  `rusty_serde`/`rusty_json`/`rusty_uuid`/`rusty_rand` first); `rusty_serde`
  chosen over `rusty_json` for serialization (fully sovereign, zero
  external deps) at the user's explicit direction. No async runtime is
  adopted yet — Phase 1 needs none; the tokio/rusty_tokio/rustils_async
  choice is deferred to whichever later phase first needs an executor.
- **Adaptation, disclosed:** the source's `ContextVar`-scoped provider
  pattern (random/time/uuid) is ported to `thread_local!` instead, since no
  async runtime is chosen yet — documented inline in each provider module
  and revisitable once a runtime lands.
- **Adaptation, disclosed:** `Event(LlmResponse)` needs ~20 fields from
  `LlmResponse` (Phase 3, not yet built); those fields are flattened onto
  `Event` as typed placeholders (mostly `rusty_serde::value::Value`) with a
  documented plan to replace them with `#[rusty_serde(flatten)] base:
  LlmResponse` once Phase 3 lands.
- **Known gap, flagged not hidden:** C0022 (`is_final_response`) and C0023
  (`has_trailing_code_execution_result`) are left `REQUIRED`, not `DONE` —
  both need real `Content`/`Part` inspection from Phase 3 for true parity;
  this port's versions cover only the branches that don't depend on those
  types.
- 31 of the 33 Phase 1 manifest rows marked `DONE` with per-row test-name
  evidence in `capability-manifest.md`; C0022/C0023 remain `REQUIRED`.

## PR #TBD — Capability roadmap: full 831-row manifest for the google/adk-python migration
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** `capability-manifest.md` — the complete capability inventory for
  the migration, one row per capability with a stable `C####` id, grouped into
  17 dependency-ordered phases (P1 core primitives through P17 deferred
  decisions). Built from 8 parallel read-only inventory passes over
  `google/adk-python`'s ~206k lines / 28 top-level modules.
- **Known limitation:** the `Existing RustyMill impl` column is populated only
  where a repo/purpose match was obvious from `platform-directory.md`'s
  heuristic — a full `scan_platform_repos.sh` pass per capability wasn't run
  at this scale; it's re-checked per-issue when each capability is actually
  worked (per the rust-migration skill's step 3).
- **Known gap, flagged not hidden:** `runners.py` (the core `Runner`/
  `InMemoryRunner` execution engine, 2609 lines) sits outside the 28 scoped
  module directories and wasn't deep-dived by any of the 8 inventory agents —
  row `C0788` flags this explicitly as a required follow-up read before P2
  can be considered fully scoped, rather than silently omitting it.
- Every row defaults `REQUIRED` per the migration's boundary contract;
  `scripts/check_manifest_coverage.sh` confirms all 831 rows parse and are
  correctly in a non-terminal state (nothing migrated yet, as expected).
- No GitHub issues have been filed yet — the user asked for the manifest
  organized into phases first, to review and pace the work themselves.

## PR #TBD — Bootstrap governance files; begin rust-migration of google/adk-python
**2026-08-21** · (link added once this PR is opened)

- **Added:** standard governance file set (repo-config) — README, ARCHITECTURE,
  CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES, ADR seed,
  PR/issue templates, `.gitattributes` (`eol=lf`).
- **Known limitation:** no Cargo workspace exists yet, so no CI workflow was
  added (repo-config skips CI generation when there's no stack manifest to run
  against) and README's Getting Started section is a placeholder.
- This is the first PR of an ongoing rust-migration-skill loop porting
  [google/adk-python](https://github.com/google/adk-python) to Rust; see
  `capability-manifest.md` (added in a follow-up PR) for the tracked capability
  list.
